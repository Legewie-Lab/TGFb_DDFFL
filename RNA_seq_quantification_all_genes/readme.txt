The CSV file contains the quantification of mRNA expression (RPKM) for all genes utilized in this study. Below are details about the columns:
Column Descriptions

    Gene Identifiers:
    The rows typically contain gene names and the RPKM values.

    Columns
        R1, R2, R3: The replicate number.
        ctl: Indicates control samples.
        low/high: Indicates TGFβ dosage (low or high concentration).
        The numbers in the column names (e.g., 45, 90, etc.) represent the time points in minutes at which the measurements were taken.

Example Column Naming Convention

    R1_ctl_45: Replicate 1, control condition, 45-minute time point.
    R2_high_90: Replicate 2, high TGFβ dosage, 90-minute time point.
    R3_low_360: Replicate 3, low TGFβ dosage, 360-minute time point.
